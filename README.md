# Security Projects 

1- SRP_authentication :

The aim of this project is to develop a form where a client can register and connect with a username and a password to a server. The authentication is based on the SRP protocol. 
Everyone can create an account and then connect with his credentials. 
The password isn't stored in neither client side nor server side. However, a verifier is stored in the mongoDB database. 

2- Hacking WIFI :

This paper contains a great variety of possible attacks on WIFI : DofS, cracking passwords (WEP,WPA,WPA2,WPS), deauthentication, disassociation... 

3- Pen_testing :
XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection and Buffer Overflow. Resolving challenges on the platform root-me.org

4- Butterfly keys :
Explaining and implementing (in Java with the library Bouncy Castle) an algorithm used to generate many keys from one seed. It can be used in connected cars to communicate with the registration authority (RA) and the certification authority (CA).
